1. Write a function pascals_triangle(rows) that prints the first rows of 
Pascal’s Triangle using nested for loops. 
pascals_triangle(5)   
Output: 
    1 
   1 1 
  1 2 1 
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
 
2. Explain how the `continue` statement works in a loop. What are some 
scenarios where using `continue` is more beneficial than restructuring 
the loop?  
   -  Coding Challenge:  Write a Python program that iterates through a list 
of numbers and prints only those numbers that are divisible by 3, using 
the `continue` statement. 
 
3. Use list comprehension to generate all Pythagorean triplets (a, b, c) 
where a² + b² = c² and a, b, c ≤ 50. 
 
4. Write a function max_consecutive_sum(nums, k) that finds the 
maximum sum of k consecutive elements in a list. 
 
5. Write a function that takes a list as an argument and modifies it by 
appending a new item. Demonstrate how changes to the list inside the 
function affect the list outside the function.
